        Returns the horizon elevation in the direction given by azim.

        However, it requires horizon (azim, elev) pairs being ordered by growing azimuth values and also uniform step
        in azimuth (i.e, neighbour azimuth values are displaced by same distance), otherwise it can return
        a wrong elevation values. Note that uniform azimuth is assumed but not checked. The azim value is assumed
        within the maximum range 0 to 360 degree, or within the range of horizon azimuth values (horizon must not
        cover full 360 degree range) but it is not checked. In future, other (more accurate) interpolation methods
        can be implemented allowing for horizon with non-uniform azimuth step.

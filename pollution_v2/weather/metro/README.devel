                      METRo Developer README file

You are currently reading the Developer README file. For general information
about METRo please read the "README" file.


========================================
== Setting up development environment ==
========================================

init_devel.sh
-------------
You need to run the 'init_devel.sh' script to prepare your working directory. 
If the script complain about the environment variable "PYTHON_INCLUDE": 
you need to set it to a valid value. Usually, it will be something like:
'export PYTHON_INCLUDE=/usr/include/pythonX.X' where the X's are the 
version numbers. You only need to run the 'init_devel.sh' script one time.

* From now on, we assume the 'init_devel.sh' script has been run.


=======================
== Compiling "model" ==
=======================

Fortran model
-------------
To compile the Fortran model you will need to perform the following action:
1) cd src/model/
2) ../../scripts/do_macadam


======================
== Building package ==

2) Change release date in the following files:
    README
    src/frontend/metro_config.py

3) Commit every change
    svn commit

4) Compile model:
    compile the Fortran model (see == Compiling "model" ==)

5) Update package list
    grep -E "^src/frontend/.*\.py" scripts/make_package.py | sort > /tmp/packaged_modules
    find src/frontend -name *.py | sort > /tmp/actual_modules
    diff -y -W 200 /tmp/packaged_modules /tmp/actual_modules
    vi scripts/make_package.py

6) Build Package
    cd scripts/ 
    ./make_package.py
    * You need a valid gpg key to be able to sign your package

=============
== Release ==
=============

1) Make a tag in SVN for the release of that version.
   You will need an access to the metro project on GNA to do that.
   The following is an example of the user Francois Fortin making a tags
   for the 3.2.4 version

   svn copy svn+ssh://francois_fortin@svn.gna.org/svn/metro/metro/trunk \
            svn+ssh://francois_fortin@svn.gna.org/svn/metro/metro/tags/metro-3.2.4
    
2) Upload package to the GNA web site (http://download.gna.org/metro/)
   scp metro-3.2.4.tar.bz2  metro-3.2.4.tar.bz2.sig
   francois_fortin@download.gna.org:/upload/metro/

3) Create a new LATEST_RELEASE file with the new version number.
   The content of the file is:

   ------------------------------------- cut here --------------------------------
   Please note:

   - The latest stable version of the METRo package is:
     metro-3.2.4
   ------------------------------------- cut here --------------------------------

4) Upload the LATEST_RELEASE file to the GNA web site
   (http://download.gna.org/metro/)
   scp LATEST_RELEASE francois_fortin@download.gna.org:/upload/metro/

METRo stands for "Model of the Environment and Temperature of Roads".
It is a road weather forecast software. With the help of observations 
provided by roads weather stations (road weather information system, RWIS) 
and the atmospheric forecast, METRo can, amongst other things, predict 
the roads conditions with particular interest such as: freezing rain, 
accumulation of snow, frost and thaw.

The Research LINE source (R-LINE) model is in continuous development by various     
groups and is based on information from these groups: Federal Government employees, 
contractors working within a United States Government contract, and non-Federal     
sources including research institutions.  These groups give the Government          
permission to use, prepare derivative works of, and distribute copies of their work 
in the R-LINE model to the public and to permit others to do so.  The United States 
Environmental Protection Agency therefore grants similar permission to use the      
R-LINE model, but users are requested to provide copies of derivative works or      
products designed to operate in the R-LINE model to the United States Government    
without restrictions as to use by others.  Software that is used with the R-LINE    
model but distributed under the GNU General Public License or the GNU Lesser        
General Public License is subject to their copyright restrictions.
